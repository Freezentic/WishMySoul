**# WishMySoul**

Hello and welcome to the WishMySoul project frontpage!
WishMySoul is an original project created by @Freezentic and @Araslauw

WishMySoul is a website which registers small annoted python programs of any level. You can read them, download them, or even load your own programs! you can only access a few basic programs at first, open an account to access to all programs, it's free! WishMySoul is an entirely self-made by invested people, that's why it's free! You can find a lot of secrets in the programs, why don't you try to find them all ;) 

*Knock, knock*
